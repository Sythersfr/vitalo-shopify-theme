            "answer": "Every Vitalo product features full formula transparency (no proprietary blends), clinically studied doses, and independent third-party testing on every batch. We believe if a supplement company hides their formula, they have something to hide."

            "answer": "Proprietary blends allow companies to list ingredients without disclosing amounts. This means they can use tiny, ineffective amounts of expensive ingredients while hiding behind the 'proprietary' label. We never use them because we have nothing to hide."
